Action takers always get results.

Because every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Here are some of the top action-takers from the Internship Program.

In my internship program, in Week 7, I will teach you how to generate leads and reach out to them at no cost. And the assignment is to take action: to send out emails to the leads.

Once the action is taken, people are getting interview calls, freelance service deals, and more.
